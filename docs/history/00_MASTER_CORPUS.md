# EAODS Unified Historical Master Corpus

## 1. Purpose

This document reunifies the EAODS material that became separated across project conversations, generated artifacts, planning records, and repository work. It preserves chronology, distinguishes plans from completed facts, and establishes a single migration narrative.

EAODS is governed as an **Enterprise Reference Operating Model** organized around four enduring pillars:

- **Govern** — authority, risk, policy, controls, assurance, and decision rights.
- **Design** — reference architectures, patterns, interfaces, threat models, and engineering standards.
- **Operate** — platform operations, reliability, incident command, telemetry, evidence, and continual improvement.
- **Build** — reference implementations, agent specifications, automation, validation, and delivery practices.

## 2. Reconstructed lineage

| Line | Reconstructed designation | Evidenced role | Corpus status |
|---|---|---|---|
| v17.0 | Enterprise Cyber Defense & Digital Resilience Framework | Foundational cyber-defense and resilience framework | Lineage verified; full source unavailable |
| v17.1 | Domain 03 Reference Architecture and Implementation Blueprint | Design and implementation architecture | Lineage verified; full source unavailable |
| v17.2 | Domain 03 Operations Manual and Executive Playbook | Operating procedures and executive governance | Lineage verified; full source unavailable |
| v17.3 | Domain 03 Reference Implementation and Platform Engineering Guide | Governed reference implementation and platform-engineering baseline | Current historical baseline |

The v17.3 line contains references to Volumes 1–11. Volume 8 was recorded as drafted, Volume 9 as completed, Volume 10 as completed and governing, and Volume 11 as completed. The complete historical bodies of Volumes 1–7 are not presently recovered.

## 3. Volume 9 integration

The recovered July 6 record establishes the intended Volume 9 integration increment:

- remove temporary `APPLY.md`;
- update `mkdocs.yml` and `ROADMAP.md`;
- add the v17.3 landing page;
- improve navigation;
- validate front matter and strict MkDocs builds; and
- add ADR-0002, defining EAODS as an Enterprise Reference Operating Model guided by Volume 10.

This work was subsequently completed through the repository’s PR #10 lineage. The historical transcript retains the earlier failed PR attempt, which occurred because no remote feature-branch commit existed at that moment. That failure is provenance, not current repository state.

## 4. Volume 10 architectural north star

The recovered canonical designation is:

> EAODS v17.3 — Enterprise Domain 03 Reference Implementation & Platform Engineering Guide, Volume 10: Enterprise Platform Operations Center (EPOC), Site Reliability Engineering & Operational Engineering Architecture

Recovered version: `17.3.9-alpha`. It extends Volumes 1–9.

Its evidenced scope includes:

- Enterprise Platform Operations Center;
- SRE and operational engineering;
- NOC, SOC, and AI Operations Center integration;
- major-incident command and escalation;
- operational runbooks;
- platform health and enterprise telemetry;
- capacity planning;
- SLIs, SLOs, reliability KPIs, and error budgets;
- cross-domain operations;
- AI-assisted operations with human approval gates;
- continuous improvement; and
- ISO 27001, NIST CSF 2.0, MITRE ATT&CK, and AI-governance integration.

Recovered canonical service example:

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| `service_id` | `SVC-00387` |
| `service_name` | `AutomationFabric` |
| owner | `PlatformEngineering` |
| operations owner | `EnterprisePlatformOperationsCenter` |
| reliability tier | `Tier3` |
| availability objective | `99.95%` |
| error-budget policy | `Enabled` |

Historical material may enrich Volume 10 but may not silently contradict it. Material deviations require a formal ADR and architecture/governance review.

## 5. Volume 11 canonical designation and resolved taxonomy conflict

The recovered canonical designation is:

> EAODS v17.3 — Enterprise Domain 03 Reference Implementation & Platform Engineering Guide, Volume 11: Enterprise Reference Control Catalog, Engineering Standards & Architecture Compliance Framework

Recovered version: `17.3.10-alpha`. It extends Volumes 1–10.

Recovered canonical control example:

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| `control_id` | `EAODS-CTRL-000184` |
| control | `Service Identity Verification` |
| domain | `Identity` |
| type | `preventive` |
| mandatory | `true` |
| validation owner | `ContinuousAssurance` |

The July 6 plan used “Volume 11 — Enterprise AI Governance Runtime,” followed by Digital Twin Operations and Executive Control Tower as Volumes 12–13. That sequence is preserved as a **superseded planning taxonomy**. It does not renumber or replace the later canonical Volume 11 control catalog.

## 6. Early EAODS-v3 transformation

EAODS-v3 began, in part, with a request to transform ten Python agent sources into Markdown handbooks with YAML descriptions:

1. `business_proposal_agent.py`
2. `detection_matcher_agent.py`
3. `executive_assistant_agent.py`
4. `incident_report_agent.py`
5. `knowledge_base_agent.py`
6. `knowledge_curator_agent copy.py`
7. `legal_compliance_agent copy.py`
8. `orchestrator_agent copy.py`
9. `portfolio_documentation_agent copy.py`
10. `threat_intel_agent copy.py`

**Update (2026-07-26):** the ten source bodies and their ten Markdown conversions were recovered and integrity-registered under EAODS-HIST-ENT-001 with SHA-256 digests (EXC-005 closed). The caution against reconstructing duties from filenames alone no longer applies — the substantive content is on record.

Conversation evidence also reported two packages, both since recovered:

- the 29-file EAODS v3 Enterprise Edition package (foundation documents, ten agent handbooks, templates, reference registry, case studies) — recovered 2026-07-26 with **29 of 29 units reconciled** (EAODS-HIST-ENT-001; EXC-006 closed); and
- the EAODS v3.2.0-alpha package (release notes, repository map, runtime roadmap, `agents.yaml`, issue/PR templates) — bodies recovered 2026-07-26 and registered under EAODS-HIST-PKG-001; both GitHub repositories were checked and **no v3.2.0-alpha Git tag or release ever existed** (EXC-007 closed).

## 7. Later draft lineage

Three dated draft records are preserved:

| Date | Artifact | Evidenced designation |
|---|---|---|
| 2026-07-07 | Enterprise Orchestrator Agent Handbook | Draft extending the preceding architectural foundation |
| 2026-07-08 | Executive Control Tower Specification | `EAODS v4.6-alpha`, `4.6.0-alpha`, Internal / Portfolio / Commercialization Candidate |
| 2026-07-09 | Enterprise Governance Operational Metrics Standard | `EAODS v4.7-alpha`, `4.7.0-alpha`, draft |

Only evidenced metadata is reconstructed. Their unavailable bodies are not synthesized.

## 8. Repository and commercial evolution

The recovered planning record sought to evolve EAODS from a documentation repository into an enterprise knowledge platform through:

- ADRs and reusable architecture patterns;
- standards-mapped control catalogs;
- runbooks and implementation playbooks;
- threat models and reference attack paths;
- assessment checklists and maturity models;
- reference implementations;
- downloadable templates and diagrams;
- repository protection, signed commits, CodeQL, secret scanning, OpenSSF Scorecard, SBOMs, and SPDX licensing; and
- a public architecture portal with search, PDFs, version selection, downloads, and developer access.

These are historical intents until individually verified against the authoritative roadmap and repository.

## 9. Controlled migration rule

Each historical unit must be:

1. inventoried;
2. assigned provenance and an evidence grade;
3. checksummed when bytes exist;
4. normalized without erasing original meaning;
5. mapped to canonical terminology and identifiers;
6. linked to governing controls, patterns, owners, and evidence;
7. validated against Volume 10 and the Volume 11 control catalog; and
8. marked migrated, superseded, or exceptioned.

No normative artifact may remain orphaned. No missing source may be silently invented.
