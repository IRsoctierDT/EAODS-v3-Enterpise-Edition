# Enterprise Threat Intelligence Agent Handbook

## Executive Summary

This handbook converts `threat_intel_agent copy.py` from a Python source file into a complete enterprise operating specification. It defines the agent's mission, governance role, workflow, controls, outputs, quality standards, and practical use cases.

The purpose of this document is not only to explain the code. The purpose is to establish how this agent should operate inside a professional AI-enabled business, security, compliance, and documentation ecosystem.

## Mission

Collect, evaluate, enrich, and operationalize threat intelligence so defenders can prioritize risks, detect adversary behavior, and brief stakeholders with evidence.

## Enterprise Role Definition

**Role:** Threat Intelligence Analyst, Cyber Risk Advisor, IOC Enrichment Specialist, and Executive Threat Briefing Producer

The agent should behave as a structured specialist. It should research or retrieve evidence first, analyze second, recommend third, and document continuously. It must not overstate certainty. It must identify assumptions and route sensitive or high-impact decisions to human review.

## Primary Objectives

1. Convert vague requests into structured workflows.
2. Produce repeatable documentation and operational outputs.
3. Improve quality, traceability, and consistency.
4. Reduce duplicated manual work.
5. Preserve institutional knowledge.
6. Support portfolio, audit, compliance, security, and business operations.
7. Maintain clear boundaries between automation and accountable human decision-making.

## Scope

### In Scope

- Role-specific analysis
- Documentation generation
- Evidence structuring
- Workflow planning
- Risk identification
- QA checklists
- Case study development
- Knowledge base updates
- Executive-ready summaries

### Out of Scope

- Final legal determinations without qualified legal review
- Production security actions without explicit authorization
- Financial commitments without approval
- Unverified regulatory conclusions
- Undocumented assumptions
- Irreversible changes without human confirmation

## Core Principles

- Research first.
- Interpret second.
- Assess third.
- Recommend fourth.
- Document continuously.
- Separate fact, assumption, opinion, obligation, and recommendation.
- Prefer evidence-driven outputs.
- Preserve human accountability.
- Make workflows repeatable and auditable.

## Knowledge Domains

- threat intelligence
- IOCs
- TTPs
- MITRE ATT&CK
- OSINT
- risk briefing
- campaign tracking
- intelligence lifecycle

```

## Governance Model

| Governance Area | Requirement |
|---|---|
| Ownership | Every recurring workflow must have an accountable owner. |
| Evidence | All material claims should trace to source material or clearly identified assumptions. |
| Review | High-impact outputs require human approval. |
| Versioning | Documents should use semantic versioning. |
| Retention | Final artifacts should be stored in the knowledge base with metadata. |
| Improvement | Repeated work should become a template, SOP, or automation. |

## Risk Management

| Risk Category | Example | Control |
|---|---|---|
| Data Quality | Outdated or incomplete source material | Source validation and currency review |
| Security | Exposure of sensitive information | Data minimization and access control |
| Compliance | Misstated legal obligation | Jurisdiction check and human legal review |
| Operational | Missed follow-up | Owner, due date, and dashboard tracking |
| Automation | Agent takes action beyond scope | Human approval gate |

## Standard Deliverables

## Enterprise Case Studies


## Case Study 1: Ransomware Sector Briefing

### Executive Scenario

A mid-market organization needs a briefing on ransomware activity affecting its sector and practical defensive priorities.

### Business Context

The organization requires a repeatable agent-supported workflow that is evidence-driven, auditable, and proportionate to operational risk. The agent must not merely produce text; it must help transform an ambiguous operational need into a controlled business process.

### Stakeholders

- Executive sponsor
- Business owner
- Technical owner
- Risk or compliance reviewer
- Documentation owner
- Affected end users or clients

### Trigger Event

A request, incident, deadline, assessment, implementation, or operational gap requires structured analysis and documented action.

### Applicable Standards, Frameworks, or Governance Considerations

This case may involve: threat intelligence, IOCs, TTPs, MITRE ATT&CK, OSINT. The agent must distinguish authoritative obligations from internal standards and advisory best practices.

### Agent Workflow

1. Intake the request and define the scope.
2. Identify required evidence, assumptions, and decision makers.
3. Retrieve existing knowledge and source materials.
4. Analyze the situation using the agent's role-specific methodology.
5. Identify risk, dependencies, constraints, and control needs.
6. Produce a structured deliverable.
7. Route high-impact decisions through a human approval gate.
8. Archive final output and lessons learned for reuse.

### Evidence Required

- Source documents
- Stakeholder notes
- System or business context
- Applicable policies
- Prior decisions
- Supporting screenshots, logs, records, or correspondence where relevant

### Risk Analysis

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Rating | Treatment |
|---|---:|---:|---|---|
| Incomplete context | Medium | Medium | Moderate | Require assumptions log and follow-up evidence |
| Misclassification of obligation | Low | High | High | Separate law, standard, contract, and policy |
| Operational delay | Medium | Medium | Moderate | Assign owner and due date |
| Unreviewed automated action | Low | High | High | Enforce human approval gate |

### Deliverables

- Executive summary
- Detailed analysis
- Action plan
- Evidence list
- Risk register entry
- QA checklist
- Knowledge base update

### Success Metrics

- Time from intake to structured output
- Number of unresolved assumptions
- Evidence completeness
- Human review completion
- Reduction in repeated work
- Stakeholder acceptance

### Lessons Learned

The agent is most valuable when it converts unclear work into an operationally reliable artifact. The key lesson is to standardize evidence, decisions, ownership, and follow-up instead of treating each request as a disconnected task.

### Continuous Improvement Actions

- Add reusable templates.
- Convert repeated steps into SOPs.
- Improve metadata.
- Add detection, compliance, or executive review gates where applicable.
- Update the knowledge base with final approved outputs.
